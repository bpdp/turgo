Some notes
==========

* [tuprolog](tuprolog.alice.unibo.it) is not available in Maven repository, so you have to grab them manually and then put the jar inside libs dir (see build.gradle for example). Originally, tuprolog doesn't include version in its jar, I manually change the jar file into tuprolog-version.jar.
